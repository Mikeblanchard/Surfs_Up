# Surfs Up!

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to determine the feasability of a year-round Surf and ice cream shop in Oahu. We will be looking specifically at historical temperature data during the months of December and June, looking at average, minimum and maximum temeratures.

## Results 

|December                                                                           |June

The significant observations from these results are as follows:

- The December data count is less than the June count. 
- The month of June is, on average, 3.9 degrees hotter than December. 
- The temperature variation is not a lot. A 2 degree maximum and an 8 degree minimum, presuably during the night. 

The fewer temperature readings from the month of December does not make us think that it would significantly shift the results; a pattern is discernable. As we look at the gradient of temperatures, we see they are most similar at the high end. This is surely an indication that the daytime temperatures are very similar, with the biggest delta occuring during the night, when Surf shops would not be as busy.

## Summary

From the data we looked at, the temperature difference is insignificant. In both June and December, a Surf and ice cream shop could be feasable. However, two additional data points to consider:

- The precipitation data. Heavy rainfall seasons or parts of the year could directly influence the beach activity during these times. We recommend cross refrencing a precipitation data set with the temperature ones laid out here. 

- Wave activity. Surely there are better times of year for surfers, which would attract more locals and travellers. Perhaps look at when major surf events are happening in Ohau and coordinate extra retail services then.
