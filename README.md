# Surfs Up!

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to determine the feasability of a year-round Surf and ice cream shop in Oahu. We will be looking specifically at historical temperature data during the months of December and June, looking at average, minimum and maximum temeratures.

The significant observations from these results are as follows:

- The December data count is less than the June count. 
- The month of June is, on average, 3.9 degrees hotter than December. 
- The temperature variation is not a lot. A 2 degree maximum and an 8 degree minimum, presuably during the night. 

The fewer temperature readings from the month of December does not make us think that it would significantly shift the results; a pattern is discernable.
